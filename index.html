        <h2>Freshman in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I'm a freshman at Bob Jones University studying Criminal Justice with a minor in Psycology. I hope to someday use this degree to pursue a career as a homicide detective.</p>
         <p>
            I am very passionate about using my God given skills to help my close friends and the people around me in my life. I've worked at a bible camp for two summers and very much enjoy mentoring young adults. 
         </p> 
         <p>
            Some of my hobbies include sailing, scuba diving, driving, Xbox, reading, music, paintball, and hunting. I firmly believe that best place to calm your mind and slow down is outdoors in our savior's wonderful creation.
